# Capstone project 
# Activity 1: App Idea Brainstorming

#### Step 1: Generate new ideas

General features of any app I end up choosing:
User-friendly design: cleana and simple user interface. easy to navigate and viaually appealing
customizable 
offline access for essential features

## Brainstorm ideas:
### Idea 1: Medication reminder app

Description: Helps individuals manage their health by allowing them to track their medications and ensure they take them as prescribed. 

Features:
- Set up medication list 
- Set up medication schedule, reminders, and alerts in case of an emergency
- journal feature: allow patients to journal their health journey and provide a personalized experience to keep track of how they feel and/or changes they are experiences as they take medication. 
- educational/informative content: useful information about the medications, what they are used for, potential side effects, tips for proper medication management. (can make app in a way that collects general information from an API so that when a specific medication is selected or added for the patient, all that information is added and saved to local storage. not sure if there is a way to do that)
- keep track of medical records, allergies, etc
- Monitor diet

Stretch features:
* HealthKit integration to track things like heart rate
* Drug interaction checker
* Enable health sharing with heallthcare providers, etc


Questions:
** Is it possible to make this app so that it is accessible to both patient and doctor? that way doctors can generate and send patients' prescriptions

### Idea 2: Learning app: 

Description: an app that provides information for medical students and professionals - access to meterials, journals, etc.
***not really in line with what i want to do


### Idea 3: Diabetes tracker
Descriptions: Patiets like my mummy can track thier blood sugar level on their phone, get alerts when it is getting too low or too high so that they can make necessary adjustments before they fall sick, and contact their healthcare providers in case any adjustments need to be made to their regimen.

Features:
- blood sugar/glucose monitoring
- real time alerts - specify lower and limits where patients will be notified when level gets to (+-5% of that level should be)
- medication tracking: implement this from idea one. reminders, log medications, dosages and schedules
- monitor their diet (mummy is always doing this heheheee): help patients better monitor diet, carbohydrate, protein, etc intake and nutritional information

## Idea 4: Fitness and Nutrition app
Helps people track their fitness journey and help them acheive their goals

Features:
- Track their fitness journey: allow users to set goals and track their weight and progress
- Provide finess and nutrition recommendations based on their goal is 
- Database of common foods along with their nutritional information
- users can set reminders for things like meal times or workout sessions

Stretch features:
- Allows user-generated content


#### Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas
## Step 2.1: The Top Two Idea
Top two ideas are:
Idea 1: Medication Reminder app
Idea 4: Fitness and Nutrition App

## Step 2.2: Evaluating Ideas
1. Medication Reminder App
    - Description: Medication Reminder app is a medication management app designed to enhance health tracking and medication maintenance.This app offers a range of features, allowing users to effortlessly set up and manage their medication lists, establish schedules with customizable reminders and emergency alerts, and maintain a personal health journal for a more nuanced understanding of their well-being throughout their journey. The app not only prioritizes user experience but also enhances knowledge with educational content about prescribed medications. Utilizing an API, it dynamically collects and saves pertinent information, including usage details, potential side effects, and management tips of medications. Additionally, the app serves as a centralized hub for tracking medical records, allergies, diet and more. 
    - Category: Health - Medications
    - Mobile: The app implements push notifications for real-time medication reminders and alerts to keep patients informed about their medication and schedules. The journaling feature allows patients to document their health journey irrespective of their physical location. 
        - (Potential) Camera integration to provide functionalities such as scanning medication barcodes or uploading images relevant to the patient's health journey. 
    - Story: The inspiration of this app comes from my mother who is a diabetic patient. Witnessing her journey has fueled a commitment to simplify health management, especially for individuals who are dealing with persistent illnesses and may not have constant access to medical guidance or care givers. The app's primary goal is to alleviate the complexities of health management, serving as a companion especially for those with ongoing illesses/ patients who are on regular or constant medications. The features, such as medication tracking, personalized journaling, and education content, all converge towards a singular goal: to empower users in taking charge of their health with ease and confidence. 
    - Market: This app is tailored for any patient seeking simplicity and effectiveness in their health management routines 
    - Habit:
        - Habit formation: The app is designed to encourage positive habits related to health management. The habit formation aims to forster a routine that contributes to improved health outcomes. 
        - Frequency of use: Given the nature of the health management, such as frequency of medication intake, the app is intended to be frequently accessed. Patients are encouraged to open the app daily to log medications, receive reminders, and document their health journey. 
        - Balanced consumption and creation: While patients primary consume information (through medication details, education content, etc), the app encourages a level of creation through the journaling feature. 
    - Scope: Considering the numerous features to implement, building this app might be challenging. However, creating a simplified version remains interesting, as it keeps the main features intact and fulfills the app's purpose. The app appears well-defined, especially for a health management brainstorming tool.

2. Fitness and Nutrition App
    - Description: The Fitness and Nutrition app is a health app designed to empower individuals on their fitness journeys. Users can set and track personalized fitness goals, monitor their weight and progress, and receive tailored fitness and nutrition recommendations based on their objectives. The app includes a database of common foods with nutritional information, facilitating informed dietary choices. With the ability to set reminders for meal times or workout sessions, users stay on track with their health routines. A user profile feature allows individuals to specify dietary preferences and restrictions, ensuring a personalized experience. 
    - Category: Lifestyle, Health and Fitness
    - Mobile: This app offers a uniquely mobile experience with real-time progress tracking, and location-based reminders. 
    - Story: The purpose of this app is to empower individuals on their fitnes journeys. Whether users are striving for weight loss, muscle gain, or overall well-being, the app enhances their journeys through progress, personalization, and achievement. 
    - Market: Considering the widespread interest in health and wellness, this app serves people across various age groups and fitness levels. 
    - Habit: The app has the potential to be habit-forming, especially for users dedicated to their fitness journeys. Regularly engagement with goal tracking, progress updates, and personalized recommendations contribute to a high frequency of use. Users are likely to open and use the app daily, especially if it becomes an integral part of their fitness routine. User actively engage with the app by setting goals, tracking progress, and personalizing their profiles. 
    - Scope: While the app involves comprehensive features, the technical challenges are moderate. Implementing goal tracking, personalized recommendations, and user profiles are common in fitness apps. The nutritional database may require some extra work, but overall, the technical aspects appear manageable. A simplified version of the app, emphasizing core features like goal tracking and personalized recommendations, will still be interesting. 


## Step 2.3: The Final Decision
Based on my app evaluations, I have decided to build the Medication Reminder App
