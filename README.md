## Reflection

Embarking on this journey is a significant moment for me, marking my first venture into app development. As a Biomedical Engineering student with aspirations in smart healthcare and health technology, this capstone project is a pivotal opportunity to initiate my portfolio. The decision to create a health app presented challenges during the brainstorming phase, with the abundance of existing health related apps. Seeking inspiration, I turned to friends, asking: "What app do you wish existed, and what features would be invaluable to you?" Realizing the app I wanted to build already existed led me to a crucial choice â€“ to infuse my app with a distinctive story.

This app is profoundly personal, rooted in the experiences of my mother, a diabetic patient. Witnessing her challenges in managing her health journey fueled my determination to make it achievable and exceptionally simple. Additionally, my passion for contributing to groundbreaking advancements in healthcare, akin to companies like Apple, adds an extra layer of significance to this endeavor. The mix of excitement, nervousness, and determination that comes with this being my first app highlights the personal journey I'm about to start.

Despite grappling with translating all my ideas into the app framework, especially intricate features like multiple screen navigations, I am hopeful that the envisioned app will come to life. This entire process, from brainstorming to setting essential goals, has been immensely helpful, and I eagerly anticipate bringing this project to fruition.

## Reflection

This week marked substantial progress in building my app, accompanied by a set of challenges that contributed to my learning journey. I successfully created the Create Account and Log In screens, established the tab bar navigation, and integrated features into the Reminders and Journal screens, achieving key milestones. Notably, I incorporated Firebase into the New Account and Log In screens, enhancing the overall functionality of the app.

However, I faced challenges in setting up the Medications Screen due to the absence of a suitable API for fetching medication information when a user adds a medication. Additionally, I struggled with uncertainty regarding the implementation of a My Account screen to store relevant user information.

Areas that require improvement have become apparent, such as enhancing the Journal Screen to retain saved entries upon app reload. I find myself questioning how to securely save login information and seamlessly connect the login/sign-up screen to the tab bar navigation screen.

Several points for further exploration and refinement have surfaced:

1. I want to explore ways to eliminate the "back" option after logging in or creating an account through segue implementation.
2. I need to investigate methods for securely saving login information.
3. I aim to enhance the reminder functionality to allow users to set recurring alarms successfully.
4. I am encountering challenges with the non-functional app logo that need to be addressed.
5. I want to integrate Firebase for the "forgot password" functionality.
6. Acquiring a medication API to support the envisioned Medication Screen is a priority.
7. I intend to explore and implement Firebase functionalities beyond basic login, such as Google Analytics.
8. I recognize the need for a deeper understanding of table view delegate and table view data source for better implementation.
9. I want to explore user defaults for saving reminders and journal entries.

In reflection, this week has provided a clear picture of both achievements and areas that demand further attention. I am committed to continuous improvement of my app, even beyond this program and I will appreciate all the help that I can receive.
